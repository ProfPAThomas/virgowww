<h1>What is the Virgo Consortium?</h1>

<p>The Virgo Consortium for Cosmological Supercomputer Simulations was founded in 1994 in response to the UK's High Performance Computing Initiative. Virgo developed rapidly into the international collaboration that it is today. Virgo developed rapidly into the international collaboration that it is today. The Virgo Consortium has a core membership of about a dozen scientists in the UK, Germany, Netherlands, the USA and China. The largest nodes are the <a href="http://icc.dur.ac.uk">Institute for Computational Cosmology</a> in Durham, UK, the <a href="http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de">Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics</a> in Garching, Germany, the <a href="http://www.h-its.org/en/">Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies</a> (HITS) in Germany and the <a href="https://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/">Leiden observatory</a> in the Netherlands.  Other nodes include Cambridge, Edinburgh, Liverpool John Moores, Manchester, Nottingham and Sussex in the UK and John's Hopkins University in the USA and the NAOC in Beijing, China. At any given time, an additional 30+ scientists, mostly PhD students and postdocs, are directly involved in aspects of the Virgo programme.</p>

<h1>Science Goals</h1>

<p>The science goals of Virgo are to carry out state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. The research areas include the large-scale distribution of dark matter, the formation of dark matter haloes, the formation and evolution of galaxies and clusters, the physics of the intergalactic medium and the properties of the intracluster gas.</p>

<h1>Resources</h1>

<p>Virgo has access to world class supercomputing resources in the UK and Germany.  There are currently two facilities at Durham - the dedicated "<a href="http://icc.dur.ac.uk/index.php?content=Computing/Cosma">Cosmology Machine</a>" with 3000 cores operated by Virgo with 14 Tb of memory and 800 Tb of disc storage, and the national DiRAC-2 datacentric system with 52 Tb memory and more than 2.5Pb of storage. In Germany supercomputers at the RZG, LRZ and FZ have been used for the biggest dark matter only structure formation calculations run by Virgo including the Millennium, Aquarius and MXXL simulations.</p>
