<h1>The Millennium Simulation</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>The Millennium Simulation was the largest N-Body Simulation ever carried out back in 2005, containing over 10 billion particles. The simulation run by the Virgo Consortium using a cluster of 512 processors located at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany. The simulations took a total of 28 days (~600 hours) of wall clock time, and thus consumed around 343000 hours worth of cpu-time. </p>

<p> The Millennium simulation was the first of a series of related simulations of cosmological volumes.  The halo and subhalo data from these simulations, together with the output of several semi-analytic galaxy formation models have been made public through databases at <a href="http://galaxy-catalogue.dur.ac.uk:8080/Millennium/">Durham</a> and <a href="http://gavo.mpa-garching.mpg.de/Millennium/">MPA Garching</a>.
</p>

<p>More than 700 papers have been published using data from the Millennium databases.  A list of papers and more information on the Millennium simulations can be found <a href="http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/millennium/">here</a>. </p>
