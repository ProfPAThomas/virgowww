<h1>Local Group Simulations</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>The Local Group is a galaxy cluster that consists of our own Milky Way galaxy, the neighbouring Andromeda galaxy, as well as hundreds of smaller galaxies. Due to its proximity, it is the environment in which we can observe galaxy formation and evolution with the highest precision. It is also where the faintest known galaxies have been detected, allowing us to probe the underlying dark matter structures in the greatest detail. By testing the lower limits of galaxy and structure formation in the Local Group, we hope to not only gain new insights into the physics of galaxies, but also to one day reveal the nature of dark matter.</p>
