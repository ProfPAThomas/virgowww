<h1>Copernicus Complexio (COCO)</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

<h4>Copernicus and his “Complexio”</h4>

<p>For as long as humans have engaged in scientific thought, one question that has always been raised is: “Do we live in a special place in the universe?”. The paradigm shifting claim by Nicolaus Copernicus was that the Sun and the Earth are not really special at all — we are not privileged observers in any sense. </p>

<p>Surprisingly, however, modern astronomy often points in a different direction — observations of the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies seem to often disagree with the predictions of the standard cosmological model. Even now, there seems to be a dilemma (or “complexio”) surrounding this question. </p>

<p>
The Copernicus Complexio (or COCO) simulations aim to replicate the observed universe with over 13 billion particles in a supercomputer to gain insight into one of the most fundamental questions in science: “Is the Milky Way unique? And if so, why?”</p>

<p>The simulations were run as part of the Virgo consortium in conjunction with the ICM at the University of Warsaw. </p>

<h4>Warm dark matter</h4>

<p>Cold dark matter (CDM) has long been the standard dark matter candidate, and has done an excellent job in matching real observations of the universe.</p>

<p>However, particle physicists tell us that there could be a different kind of particle, known as a sterile neutrino, which would constitute warm dark matter (WDM), in which the particles move much faster in the early universe.</p>

<p>The two models make different predictions for the nature of structure formation in the universe, with fewer low-mass haloes (the gravitational sinks in which galaxies form) being created in WDM. COCO simulates WDM and CDM cosmologies to test the differences between the two. </p>
